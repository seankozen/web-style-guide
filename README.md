- The application is a web style guide for a possible website.
## Why I built the project this way
- The goal of this project was to create a web style guide commonly used in creating a website.
- It required the use of Sass as it would be used in a real world project (Sass partial files). 
## If I had more time I would change this
- Add more elements that could be used on the web page.
## Running the Project
